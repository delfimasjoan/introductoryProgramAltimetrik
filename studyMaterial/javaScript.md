# JavaScript

To get a general idea of each topic, I started watching the corresponding videos on the Youtube channel [Cocina del c√≥digo](https://www.youtube.com/c/LaCocinadelC%C3%B3digo)
The study material for getting to know JavaScript syntax and basic constructs was taken from [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) and [developer.mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics).
