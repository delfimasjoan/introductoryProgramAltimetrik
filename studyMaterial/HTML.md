# HTML

To begin with, I read [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) info about HTML, to get the general idea, and to look for the differences with XHTML I investigated the information on [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-xhtml-and-html5/)

### Meta tags:

Meta tags provide information about the webpage in the HTML of the document, they will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
 
 *The information studied can be found [here](https://moz.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-seo-meta-tags)*
 
 ### Input types:
 
 The <input> element has different types. Within them we can find "text", "password", "email", "buttom", "submit", and much more!
 
 ### Data attributes:
 
data- attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, it is used to store custom data private to the page or application, giving the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements.

*For this section, in addition to the w3school, material was also taken from [developer.mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes)*

### Accessibility

Accessibility is about making web pages accessible for everyone, also people with disabilities. To obtain this the code should be as semantic as possible.

### Semantic HTML

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. A semantic Web allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities
